Reporting Security Issues
=========================

I take security bugs in SOHT2 seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your
findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security
Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/domax/soht2/security/advisories/new) tab.

I'll send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to
your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may
ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in a third-party library to the person or team maintaining the library.

Please do not report security bugs through public GitHub issues, as this will delay the fix and may
expose users to unnecessary risk.
