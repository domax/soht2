Contributing
============

Hi there! I'm thrilled that you'd like to contribute to my project. Your help is essential.
Our [README](README.md) describes the project, its purpose, warnings and is necessary reading
for contributors.

Contributions to this project are dedicated to the public domain under [MIT](LICENSE.txt).

Remember that information in this
repo [is not legal advice and comes without warranty](README.md#disclaimer).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

Getting Started
---------------

The two main ways to contribute are through issues and pull requests.

Before you decide to open an issue,
browse [open issues](https://github.com/domax/soht2/issues) to see current requests. I also
generally want to hear about:

* Issues regarding performance, usability, or security.
* Bug fixes or improvements to existing code.
* New features or enhancements to existing features.
* Typos or clearer wording in UX and documentation.
* Questions about how to use the project or its features.
* Suggestions for improving the project or its documentation.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/domax/soht2/issues/new) to tell me about any of the above.
You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an
issue.

**NOTE:** Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to
be addressed, resolved, fixed, or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This
helps me know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone to watch the
issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request, please do so directly in
the [SOHT2 repo](https://github.com/domax/soht2/pulls). Please be aware that it is unlikely that I
will merge your pull request directly unless it is thoroughly reviewed and tested. It's not because
I don't like your ideas, but because I may need to iterate on them internally, according to my
overall vision for the project.
